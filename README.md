Much of the code started life elseware and I greatly appriciate those authors.  

I am using this mostly to just learn some lessons on my SC722 18MHz Z180 modular computer from https://smallcomputercentral.com/sc792-modular-z180-computer/

I am writing directly to hardware and breaking portability (RomWBW HBIOS calls, Z180 specific instructions, ...)
